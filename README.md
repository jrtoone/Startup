> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Very early in my life I was diagnosed with clinical OCD. Because of this, I do many things differently than 'normal' people. One of those things I am very particular about, is my calandar. I live and breathe by my calandar. But sometimes, my calandar controls me more than I control it. What if there was a calandar designed from the ground up, with mental health in mind? I think many of us, even those without mental health struggles, could benefit from a calandar focused on maintaining a healthy state of mind.

This calandar would recognize when you are overburdening yourself. It could recognize unsustainable 'bursts' of productivity and help you balance it with a healthy, sustainable growth pattern. Conversly, it could help you understand when you are being 'lazy' or too unproductive, and help encourage you to do more and be better. All of this, without compromising critical functionality of other calendar apps.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Basic Calandar Functionality
- 'Do It' dates and 'Due Dates'
- Prompts that tell you when you are overexerting
- Prompts that tell you when you are underexerting


### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure the webpage and organize the calandar
- **CSS** - Beautify the calandar
- **React** - Due it Dates dynamically showing time remaining, Login service
- **Service** - Backend storage of calandared items
- **DB/Login** - User Storage
- **WebSocket** - Unclear how I am going to implement this for the class. I want to set up a way where you can share calandars with friends, but if that proves too much i will likely implement a texting feature
